FINA5524 Trading Simulation
1.1 Part II – Final Submission (20% of overall mark)
This submission provides you with an opportunity to reflect on your expectations of the simulation versus the lived reality and your own trading performance.
You should reflect on the objectives of two to four of the trading simulations held during weeks 7 and 8 and describe your observations on the market. To provide an insightful analysis, you should select sessions where you participated in different roles (i.e. informed vs. uninformed trader). It is usually better to provide detailed and insight analysis on fewer simulations.
This section should include:1. Discussion as to how the observed market characteristics of each session differed from the expectations set out in your interim submission;2. Analysis of market quality measures and discussion on price efficiency;3. Evaluation of your adopted trading strategies. If your actual trading strategy differed from that suggested in the interim submission then explain why. In this part of the report you should discuss your profits (as an informed trader) and trading costs (as a liquidity trader). Your analysis of trading costs should incorporate a minimum of three methods discussed in class. You should provide calculations (in appendix if necessary);4. Reflect on whether you would retain or make changes to the strategies if you were given the opportunity to replay the simulation.
The “time and sales” data and “transaction log” data for each session will be available on LMS after the trading games (the “news” data will not be p代 写FINA5524 Trading SimulationSPSS

This submission should focus on reflection. Reflect on a) what happened during the simulation sessions and how this differed from theory, and b) your trading performance. Should contain statements such as:· When ….. changed, I expected…… This did / didn’t happen during the simulation because…..· If I encountered this again, then I would…..· Measure performance using metrics discussed in class.
